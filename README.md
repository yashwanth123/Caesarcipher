# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Python Console App

This is a simple Python-based implementation of the classic **Caesar Cipher**, which is one of the earliest and simplest forms of encryption. This project allows you to **encrypt and decrypt messages** by shifting letters of the alphabet.

---

## 📖 How It Works

- Each letter in the input text is shifted by a fixed number (the "key").
- For example, with a shift of 3:
  - A → D, B → E, Z → C
- Decryption reverses the shift.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Encrypt messages using Caesar cipher logic
- Decrypt messages using the same shift
- ASCII banner/logo for visual polish
- Handles wrap-around for Z → A
- Ignores non-alphabet characters (e.g., punctuation)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the program from the terminal:

```bash
python main.py
